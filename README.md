# How computers work
## ALLWAYS people make tools to solve there problems like humers, wheel narrow.and all of this are for manual works.
## over time people began to wonder if the machine help us with Thinking works.
## to build a thinking machine it have to performed four tasks
### 1- Input
### 2- Storage 
### 3- Processing
### 4- Output
 
## the computers work on ONE & ZEROES, Becaus of computers use wires and circuts  in the single wire the is a flow of electrecity and the single key can be on or off (on=1 , off= 0).
### The ON,OFF created a BIT whiche is the smallest piece of information a computer can store and with more BITS you can represent more complex information.
## Numbers system:
### 1. In the decimal system we have 10 digits from 0 to 9 and this help us to count.
### 2. In the Binary system we only have two digits 0 and 1

## with 8 wires you can store numbers between 1 to 255 but with 32 wires it will be from 1 to 4 billion.
## fore store TEXTS WE give each letter a number starting with 1 and then convert the decimal number to binary number.
## each image was created by pixels and each pixel have color and each color can represnted by numbers.
